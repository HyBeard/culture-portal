An important role in the development of the Belarusian literature was played by the first legal newspapers in the Belarusian language "Nasha доля" and "Nasha ніва", which united the most famous authors of that time: Y. Kupala, Y. Kolas, E. Pashkevich, M. Bogdanovich, Z. Byadulya, M. Horetsky, S. Yadvigin and others.

The Belarusian literature of the twentieth century is represented by outstanding names of national poets J. Kupala, J. Kolas, R. Borodulin, P. Brovka, N. Gilevich, A. Kuleshov, P. Panchenko, M. Tank, national writers V. Bykov, J. Brylya, K. Krapiva, M. Lynkov, A. Makaenka, I. Melezh, I. Naumenko, I. Chigrinov, I. Shamyakin. Their works, as well as many other poets, writers, playwrights, within a relatively short period of time have put the Belarusian literature on a par with the advanced world literature.

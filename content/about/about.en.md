## The information on this portal is dedicated to the writers of Belarus

The origins of the Belarusian literature lie in oral poetic art and folklore. Literature originated with the advent of writing in the 10th century. The largest centre of writing distribution was Polotsk, where local chronicles appeared in XII-XIII centuries. Kirill Turovsky, a master of oratorical prose, lived and worked in Turov. In the XIV-XV centuries, the Belarusian language received the status of the state language in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, where the Statutes of the GDL of 1529, 1566 and 1588 were written. The 16th century was marked by the activity of the Belarusian humanist and enlightener, founder of East Slavonic book printing, writer and translator Francis Skorina. The first Renaissance poem in Latin about his native land "The Song about the Bison" was written by M. Gussovsky. The publicist and translator S. Budny published in Nesvizh "Catechism" - the first book in the old Belarusian language in the territory of modern Belarus. Defender of the native word V. Tyapinski was the first who translated the Gospel into the Belarusian language. Simeon Polotskiy contributed to the development of the Belarusian book poetry in the XVII century.

The establishment of new Belarusian literature was in the second half of the XVIII-XIX centuries. In the XIX century the Belarusian land was glorified by the poet A. Mickiewicz, playwright V. Dunin-Martsinkiewicz. The epoch of realism is connected with the flourishing of F. Bogushevich, A. Gurinovich and J. Luchina.

An important role in the development of the Belarusian literature was played by the first legal newspapers in the Belarusian language \ "Nasha доля\" and \ "Nasha ніва\", which united the most famous authors of that time: Y. Kupala, Y. Kolas, E. Pashkevich, M. Bogdanovich, Z. Byadulya, M. Horetsky, S. Yadvigin and others.

The Belarusian literature of the twentieth century is represented by outstanding names of national poets J. Kupala, J. Kolas, R. Borodulin, P. Brovka, N. Gilevich, A. Kuleshov, P. Panchenko, M. Tank, national writers V. Bykov, J. Brylya, K. Krapiva, M. Lynkov, A. Makaenka, I. Melezh, I. Naumenko, I. Chigrinov, I. Shamyakin. Their works, as well as many other poets, writers, playwrights, within a relatively short period of time have put the Belarusian literature on a par with the advanced world literature.
